Source-Code-Analyzer-for-Linux
==============================

Because of lack of proper tool to read source code under Linux,we,our partners,want to develop one tool working like Source Insight that costs less memory than Eclipse,works more stably than Code::Blocks and is much easier to configure than VIM……Hope our project will help to read Linux Kernel source code to promote the development for Linux.Thanks,welcome in!
